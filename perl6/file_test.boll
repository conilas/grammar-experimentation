//  Let's say I want to have a  new declaration. We have three ways to do so:

//  1. Allow the type Natural to be the Universe of value Int > 0
  let Natural be the Universe Int > 0
//  2. Allow int to be a Universe and attribute a direct value
  let Natural be Universe = Int > 0
//  3. Programmers
  let Natural : Universe = Int > 0

// This is a more-than-one-line function
  let division be the Fn (dividend is Natural, divisor is Int) => {
    let ble be Natural = 1
    let cle be Natural = 1
  }

// This is a one-liner function
  let division_one_liner be Fn = (dividend: Naturals, divisor: Int) => divisor/dividend

// This is just some value decl
  let x be Natural = 1
  let x be the Natural 1
}
